## SSD Assignment 4 Python ##

For Q1, pattern printing, simply run `python3 pattern.py`, no modules required
exact pattern as shown in question is displayed, no input required.

For Q2, please make sure the data_ssd.csv file is present to check with loading some dummy data.
A menu based input is required with each action clearly mentioned along with any prompts for subsequent 
input, if any (eg. in add entry, update entry the key is needed). The data is stored in runtime only,
and NOT written back into the csv file as mentioned above.

For loading from csv file, keep the columns in the same order as data_ssd.csv as an example.
Search is case insensitive. For update give the same field name as available, one field in a
single operation.

Run: `pip install shortuuid`
     `python3 address.py` and then give input as directed. No validation is there but table will be 
    formatted during display.

For Q3, run `pip install matplotlib`, then `python3 map.py`. Give the full raw_input in terminal and press enter.
